/**
 * Create a string under weird constraints.
 *
 * This is a hard test.
 *
 * You are only allowed to change the code between the start and end. And, you cannot use any literals or
 * keywords. This includes primitives. So no if, for, class, new, int, long or other keyword. And no string or
 * numeric literals either. However, you are still allowed to use these values if they are returned from a
 * function, or as arguments too a function (using auto boxing). You are just not allowed to write the specific
 * words.
 * 
 * All operators are allowed (+, -, *, =, &amp; and so on)
